dialogues control sequence:
		when a parameter is NUM.
		'.' is optional if NUM is followed by any non digit char
		NUM can only contains digit char [0-9] 

		\$NUM. : is replace with variable NUM
		\PNUM. : pause the dialogue for NUM tick
		\ENUM. : is replace with texture ...
		\XNUM. : set x position
		\YNUM. : set y position
		\RNUM. : set the R color of the text
		\GNUM. : set the G color of the text
		\BNUM. : set the B color of the text
		\W : make so that the dialoguw wait for input
		\SNUM. : set the dialogue style
		\FNUM. : set font
